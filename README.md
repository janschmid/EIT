# EIT-DAS

**For devs that wish to push to this repository,
beaware of the webhooks generated by the -pre-commit-config.yaml**

## Pre-commits and webhooks:
Before a commit is accepted, the it runs a set of git scripts outlined in
the .pre-commit-config.yaml file.
To use this feature, install pre-commit through pip, [a guide can be found here]
(https://pre-commit.com/)
This tests the files for the following:
* Docker
    * docker-clang-format\* - Run `clang-format` against C/C++ header and source files in Docker container
    * docker-cpplint - Run `cpplint` against C/C++ header and source files in Docker container
    * docker-cppcheck\* - Run `cppcheck` against C/C++ source files in Docker container
    * docker-compose-check - Checks that docker-compose files are valid
    *
* Cpp
    * clang-format\* - Formats C, C++, Objective-C, and Java code [Using Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
    * clang-tidy\* - Find warnings/errors in C, C++, and Objective-C code
    * cppcheck\* - Find warnings/errors in C, C++, and Objective-C code
    * cpplint - Find warnings/errors in C/CPP code
* Python

* Overall
    * end-of-file-fixer - Ensures that a file is either empty, or ends with one newline.
    * name-tests-test - This verifies that test files are named correctly
    * trailing-whitespace - This hook trims trailing whitespace.
    * check-yaml - This hook checks yaml files for parseable syntax.

To run the hooks noted with \*, the following needs to be install in the enviroment:
'''apt install clang clang-format clang-tidy cppcheck'''
'''pip install cpplint'''

### Testing:
Every branch, before it is merged to master, will have to go through pre-exisiting tests using googletest.
If no test is available for your newly added feature, you are write some, [following this guide](https://google.github.io/googletest/primer.html)
